HTTP Authentication plugin for Redmine
=======

This plugin enables an optional HTTP authentication method in the Redmine
project management tool.

If the REMOTE_USER server environment variable is set, an attempt is
made to look up the matching local user account and log in. If the user
was logged in using HTTP authentication, and the REMOTE_USER gets unset
(ie. the user was logged out by the container), the user will be logged
out from their Redmine session, too.

This module does not disable the form-based login unless HTTP authentication
credentials are available, in which case the username from the environment
will override the form-based login.


Important notes
=======

Please note that your users must have their local Redmine account in order
to log in, and their login name must match the credentials from the container
authentication, since this plugin does not (yet) handle automatic registration.


Installation
=======

Use the following command in your Redmine instance directory:

# ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/AdamLantos/redmine_http_auth.git


Known issues
=======

If you encounter "uninitialized constant Rails::Plugin::ApplicationController"
exception with any Redmine version prior to Redmine-0.9, just rename your
app/controllers/application.rb to app/controllers/application_controller.rb.


Planned features
=======

- configurable account mapping (ie. use any environment variable and look
  up users by login name or email address)
- automatic registration of accounts
- option to disable form-based login for users when the plugin is activated
