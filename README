HTTP Authentication plugin for Redmine
=======

This plugin enables an optional HTTP authentication method in the Redmine
project management tool.

If the REMOTE_USER server environment variable is set, an attempt is
made to look up the matching local user account and log in. If the user
was logged in using HTTP authentication, and the REMOTE_USER gets unset
(ie. the user was logged out by the container), the user will be logged
out from their Redmine session, too.

This module does not disable the form-based login unless HTTP authentication
credentials are available, in which case the username from the environment
will override the form-based login.


Important notes
=======

Please note that your users must have their local Redmine account in order
to log in, and their login name / email address must match the credentials from
the container authentication, since this plugin does not (yet) handle automatic
registration.


Installation
=======

Use the following command in your Redmine instance directory:

# ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/AdamLantos/redmine_http_auth.git


Settings
=======

The behavior of this plugin can be customized through the 'settings' page in the
plugins menu. Currently there are three options:

- enable / disable HTTP Authentication (default: enable)
- set the header / environment value to look for (default: REMOTE_USER)
- change local user lookup mode from login name to email address
  (default: login name)


Known issues
=======

If you encounter "uninitialized constant Rails::Plugin::ApplicationController"
exception with any Redmine version prior to Redmine-0.9, just rename your
app/controllers/application.rb to app/controllers/application_controller.rb.


Planned features
=======

- automatic registration of accounts
- option to disable form-based login for users when the plugin is activated
- integration with the custom features of various SSO systems (eg. Shibboleth)
